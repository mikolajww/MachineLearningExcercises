    "\n",
    "### Task. Computer Virus.\n",
    "Read the data from the `virus.npz` file. This is a dataset with information about the spread of XXYZ0123 virus that took over many computers a few years back. The $x$ contains a number of hours (counting from first reported detections), and the $y$ contains the number of infected computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Your task is to approximate the spread function. Note that this time the function is not linear.\n",

    "* Display the data on the chart (scatter plot)\n",
    "* Use gradient descent to find a solution.\n",

    "    * b) after two months (60 days)?\n",
    "    * c) Display both predictions on the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: To approximate a different function using linear regression you need to change the input data (the $x$ in this case). For instance, if you wish to approximate $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ all you need to do is create a new input: $x' = \\sqrt{x}$ and perform exactly the same steps as in previous laboratory, but using $x'$ instead of $x$.\n",
